# MTMC - MonTana state Mini Computer

The MonTana state Mini Computer is a virtual computer intended to show how digital computation works in a fun and visual way.

The MTSC combines ideas from the [PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11), [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture),
 [Scott CPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRg5hRlywIg), [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) and
 [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) to make a relatively simple 16-bit computer that can accomplish basic computing tasks.

The computer is displayed via a web interface that includes all the I/O such as console and display, visual representations of the computer state, and a built in code editor to construct and debug software for the computer.
